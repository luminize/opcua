# initial cmake CMakeLists.txt file for building a server
# out of the open62541 library examples
# applicable library files have been generated by the open62541
# project and put in the shares_62541 directory.
#
# build "shared libs" and "amalgamated" so we use the generated
# open62541.h/.c files from the open62541/build directory
# and the 4 files in open62541/build/bin/Debug directory
#
# after compiling and linking, make sure to copy the
# open62541.dll file to the build/Debug directory
#
# from the root/build directory of this project (opcua):
# cmake ..
# cmake --build .
